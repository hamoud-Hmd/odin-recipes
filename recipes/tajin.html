    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p> Tajin is a Moroccan dish, and it refers to a type of earthenware pot that is commonly used in Moroccan cuisine for cooking and serving food. The name "Tajin" also refers to the dish that is cooked and served in this pot, which typically includes meat (such as lamb or chicken), vegetables, and a variety of spices, including cumin, paprika, and saffron.

Once the Tajin is cooked, it is often served with couscous or bread</p>
